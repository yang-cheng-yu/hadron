            <div>
                <p>
                    We started out in 1987 developing original design software for Windows, carving out a niche 
                    with creative tools that aimed to empower artists, designers, and hobbyists alike. Over the 
                    next two decades, we built a reliable suite of desktop apps that helped define a generation 
                    of digital creativity. But like many legacy systems, our original codebase became 
                    outdated—difficult to maintain, limited to one platform, and out of sync with the evolving 
                    needs of modern creatives.<br><br>

                    That’s when we decided to reinvent everything. We embraced a new philosophy: fast, 
                    cross-platform, and intuitive tools built from the ground up with today’s creators in mind. 
                    Our relaunch as Hadron was a bold move, shifting focus toward not only polished original apps
                    but also creating a platform for user-submitted projects—whether it's indie games, 
                    experimental art, or functional web utilities. The goal was simple: build a hub where 
                    innovation meets accessibility.<br><br>

                    The Hadron web store isn’t just about software anymore. It’s become a growing community 
                    and marketplace for designers, gamers, coders, and digital artists to share, showcase, and 
                    support each other’s work. We value creativity in all forms, and our platform is designed 
                    to be as flexible and dynamic as the projects it hosts. From hand-coded games to abstract 
                    design tools, Hadron continues to evolve with the people who use it.<br><br>

                    This site is also the final project for our Internet Programming course at Vanier College. 
                    Internet Programming course project by Cheng Yu Yang and David Sabb. This web design project
                    was made entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—with no server-end functionality
                    implemented. Our goal was to create a clean, functional, and expressive platform prototype 
                    that reflects the spirit of Hadron: creativity without constraints.<br><br>
